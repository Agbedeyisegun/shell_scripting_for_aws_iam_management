## Below are the steps and screenshots of the of the project



- step 1 Introduction
This script automates AWS IAM user and group management for CloudOps Solutions. It:

Creates 5 IAM users

Creates an admin group

Attaches the AdministratorAccess policy

Adds all users to the group

- step 2  Design Decisions
Modular Functions: Each task (user creation, group setup) is separated for clarity.

Error Handling: Gracefully skips existing resources instead of failing.

Logging: All operations are logged to a timestamped file.

Verification: Includes a final check to confirm setup success.

- step 3 How to Use

Save the script as aws-iam-manager.sh

Make the file executable with the below cmd:
`chmod +x aws-iam-manager.sh`

Run the script with:
`./aws-iam-manager.sh`


Check logs with the below cmd:

`cat iam_setup_*.log`


- step 4 Verification Commands
To manually verify:

bash
# List all IAM users
aws iam list-users

# Check group memberships
aws iam list-groups-for-user --user-name devops_user1

# Verify policy attachment
aws iam list-attached-group-policies --group-name admin
